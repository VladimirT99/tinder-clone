This app is a clone of the dating App Tinder.

1. It provides swipable cards.
2. The information of the cards is generated by a firestore database in firebase.
3. The header icons are clickable.
4. By clicking the chat icon you go to the chat screen.
5. By clicking on the chat with Sarah you can get into the chatting room.
6. The tinder icon diverts you to the home page.
7. And the back button diverts you to the previous page.

While creating this App I learned a lot about React, React router and Firebase.
